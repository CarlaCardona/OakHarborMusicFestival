            <h3>Scholarship Selection Process</h3>
            <p>Our scholarship selection process begins with applicants submitting recorded auditions or performing at one of two open showcases before our selection committee. The committee members evaluate candidates based on their technical proficiency, musicality, interpretation, tone quality and overall stage presence. Many of our programs require participants to perform 2-3 pieces from different genres to showcase the artists’ versatility. Following the auditions, our committee members (which change every year) will use a standardized scoring rubrics to ensure fairness and consistency. Final decisions will consider the audition performance, as well as: academic records, recommendations, and personal statements about the student’s goals within music. The scholarship then ranks candidates and awards scholarships based on available funding with top performers receiving full or partial tuition assistance as well as a special spot on one of its anual Oak Harbor “Up Next” talent showcase.</p><br>
